Easily embed White House petitions from We The People into your WordPress site via shortcodes and widgets.


== Description ==

In May 2013 the White House released an API for We The People, a petition application designed to give citizens a direct line to the White House. After reaching a certain threshold of signatures the White House will issue an official response to the petition.

This plugin allows WordPress site owners to search and embed petitions from We The People into WordPress. Perhaps you're writing an opinion piece on a petition and want real-time statistics on signatures and any response from the White House. Or maybe you're a supporter of a particular issue and want to feature it on your sidebar to help promote awareness. The ease of WordPress with the totally customizable templates of the We The People plugin give you the power to share what's important to you.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the '/we-the-people/' plugin directory to '/wp-content/plugins' or install it through the WordPress plugin manager
2. Activate the plugin
3. That's it!
